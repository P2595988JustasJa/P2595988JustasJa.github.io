    <a class="para3"> "Graffiti - a form of visual communication, usually illegal, involving the unauthorized marking of public space by an individual or group. Although the common image of graffiti is a stylistic symbol or phrase spray-painted on a
      wall by a member of a street gang, some graffiti is not gang-related. Graffiti can be understood as antisocial behaviour performed in order to gain attention or as a form of thrill seeking, but it also can be understood as an expressive art
      form.

      Derived from the Italian word graffio (“scratch”), graffiti (“incised inscriptions,” plural but often used as singular) has a long history. For example, markings have been found in ancient Roman ruins, in the remains of the Mayan city of Tikal
      in Central America, on rocks in Spain dating to the 16th century, and in medieval English churches. During the 20th century, graffiti in the United States and Europe was closely associated with gangs, who used it for a variety of purposes: for
      identifying or claiming territory, for memorializing dead gang members in an informal “obituary,” for boasting about acts (e.g., crimes) committed by gang members, and for challenging rival gangs as a prelude to violent confrontations. Graffiti
      was particularly prominent in major urban centres throughout the world, especially in the United States and Europe; common targets were subways, billboards, and walls. In the 1990s there emerged a new form of graffiti, known as “tagging,” which
      entailed the repeated use of a single symbol or series of symbols to mark territory. In order to attract the most attention possible, this type of graffiti usually appeared in strategically or centrally located neighbourhoods." - Britannica

  <h2>TAGGING</h2>

    <a class="para3"> "Graffiti can describe any writings or drawings created on a surface in a public space. Tagging refers explicitly to writing the artist’s signature (or their pseudonym name or logo) on a public surface. This distinct signature
      is known as a “tag”, and the artist is referred to colloquially as a “tagger”. Tagging is the original and simplest form of graffiti; it is also the most common and can be seen in cities worldwide.
      Graffiti may seem like a modern 20th-century art phenomenon. But tagging in its most basic form has been around for centuries.
      It was common practice even in ancient Greek and Roman times for people to paint or scratch their names on the surface of public buildings. You can still find some of this ancient graffiti on historical buildings even today.
      However, it wasn’t until the 1960s that graffiti innovators created the street art culture we recognize today as graffiti. Artists like Cornbread and other youths in New York and Philadelphia started tagging their names on public surfaces. The
      locations for these tags became more inventive and more challenging to reach as tagging culture matured." - Eden Gallery </a>

      <a class="para3"> "A ‘piece is a graffiti picture that has been painted freehand. The name, as you may have guessed, is short for a masterpiece.
        These artworks contain at least three colors and usually take longer to paint than a tag. A ‘piece will often reach a level of public acceptability that most graffiti does not achieve.
        A ‘piece created in an obvious place will gain respect from both the public and other artists.
        It may be perceived as street art, assumed to have been painted with permission.
        However, it is still illegal and gains respect from graffiti artists – because standing in public places painting walls without permission takes a significant risk.
        Famous artists using this style include Daze, Lady Pink, Taps & Moses, and Horfe." - Eden Gallery </a>
